# Klipper integration

Please see [Klipper-Toolchanger](https://github.com/viesturz/klipper-toolchanger/)

## CPAP

Feel free to adapt my [CPAP config](./CPAP_mcu.cfg). That is based on a dedicated toolbard.
You will need to change the pin assignment if you are using something else..

Please file a bug if you are interested in detailed build instructions for the CPAP box.
